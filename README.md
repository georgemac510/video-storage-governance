# Video Storage Governance App

This is an implementation of the Gnosis Zodiac Reality.eth governance app which will be used as a a DAO for the Disco-Rock-Repo Video Storage and Retrieval app (https://disco-rock-repo.onrender.com/)

The governance app will use the Gnosis Rinkeby safe wallet (https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io/) with the Gnosis Zodiac Reality.eth module (https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality) to create governing proposals and setup voting through the Snapshot voting app.

The completed app is running and ready for some proposal voting at: 

      https://snapshot.org/#/disco-rock.eth

The address of our Rinkeby Reality.eth Module contract is `0x81012E9c34d0B86efD057105581Dbaa5A54972F5`.
